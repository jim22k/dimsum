# Dimsum

Library built on top of GraphBLAS to behave more like a DataFrame than a Matrix.

A schema made of Dimensions is defined upfront and provides the foundation for elegant
dimensional pivoting, reductions, and other manipulations.

### To Install

```
conda install pandas
conda install -c conda-forge grblas
pip install dimsum
```

### Documentation

Documentation will come soon. Until then, look at the Demo notebook for explanation of basic concepts.
